# SharePoint Agents Finder declarative agent

## Summary

SharePoint Agents Finder uses the Microsoft Graph API as a Copilot plugin in a declarative agent, leveraging the Microsoft Graph Search API /search/query endpoint to retrieve information about SharePoint Agents and event any file in Microsoft 365. It helps end users or IT Admins get info about SharePoint Agents in SharePoint or find files in Microsoft 365 using Graph API Search!

## Prerequisites

1. **Entra ID App Registration**:
   - Register an Entra ID application.
   - Assign the Graph API permissions: `Files.Read.All` as delegated permissions.
   - Retrieve the `ClientId`, `ClientSecret`, and `TenantID`.
   - Add the https://teams.microsoft.com/api/platform/v1.0/oAuthRedirect as a redirect URL for web platform in the Authentication settings.

2. **Teams developer portal**:
   - Open [Teams developer portal](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/)
   - Add a new OAuth client registration 
   - Register a new client with the following information 
        - Registration name: da-sharepoint-agents-finder
        - Base URL: https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0
        - Restrict usage by org: My organization only
        - Restrict usage by app: Any Teams app (when agent is deployed, use the Teams app ID).

   - OAuth settings
        - Client ID: `<the entra ID application ID>`
        - Client secret: `<the Entra ID application secret>`
        - Authorization endpoint `(replace tenantid by your own value)`: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/tenantid/oauth2/v2.0/authorize`
        - Token endpoint `(replace tenantid by your own value)`: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/tenantid/oauth2/v2.0/token`
        - Refresh endpoint `(replace tenantid by your own value)`: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/tenantid/oauth2/v2.0/refresh`
        - Scope: Files.Read.All
        - Save the information. 
        - A new OAuth registration key will be generated. Save it in secure place to be added in `.env.dev`

1. First, select the Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit icon on the left in the VS Code toolbar.
2. In the Account section, sign in with your [Microsoft 365 account](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/accounts) if you haven't already.
3. Create app by clicking `Provision` in "Lifecycle" section.
4. Select `Preview in Copilot (Edge)` or `Preview in Copilot (Chrome)` from the launch configuration dropdown.
5. Once the Copilot agent is loaded in the browser, click on the "â€¦" menu and select "Copilot chats". You will see your declarative agent on the right rail. Clicking on it will change the experience to showcase the logo and name of your declarative agent.
6. Ask a question to your declarative agent and it should respond based on the instructions provided.

| `m365agents.yml` | This is the main Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit project file. The project file defines two primary things: Properties and configuration Stage definitions. |

## Extend the template

- [Add conversation starters](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/build-declarative-agents?tabs=ttk&tutorial-step=3): Conversation starters are hints that are displayed to the user to demonstrate how they can get started using the declarative agent.
- [Add web content](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/build-declarative-agents?tabs=ttk&tutorial-step=4) for the ability to search web information.
- [Add OneDrive and SharePoint content](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/build-declarative-agents?tabs=ttk&tutorial-step=5) as grounding knowledge for the agent.
- [Add Microsoft Copilot connectors content](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/build-declarative-agents?tabs=ttk&tutorial-step=6) to ground agent with enterprise knowledge.
- [Add API plugins](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/build-declarative-agents?tabs=ttk&tutorial-step=7) for agent to interact with REST APIs.

      flows:
        authorizationCode:
          authorizationUrl: https://login.microsoftonline.com/tenantid/oauth2/v2.0/authorize
          tokenUrl: https://login.microsoftonline.com/tenantid/oauth2/v2.0/token`
   ```
3. **Update .env.dev file**:
   - Ensure you open this file and update this `AZUREAADV2_REGISTRATION_ID` key with OAuth registration key generated in the prerequisites
   

## Key Features
- **Interactive Chat experience**: The SharePoint Agents Finder declarative agent offers a seamless and interactive chat experience within the Microsoft 365 Copilot chat interface.
- **Graph API Integration**: Utilizes the Microsoft Graph API as a Copilot plugin in a declarative agent.
- **Querying Microsoft 365 and SharePoint content**: Querying Microsoft 365 and SharePoint content delivering structured responses in table format with links to files.
- **SharePoint Agents Finder or SharePoint Agents doc finder**: As long as the agent utilizes the Microsoft Graph API search then it could find not only SharePoint Agents but also any document in Microsoft 365.

## Potential Improvements
- **Table of Responses**: Table of Responses is a potential improvement that could be improved through the instructions
- **SharePoint Agent Link**: SharePoint Agent Link should be improved to either direct you to the agent or the link of the agent should appear in the SiteAssets library.
